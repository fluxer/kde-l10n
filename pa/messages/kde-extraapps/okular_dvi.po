"uses for these tasks are called 'device drivers'; there is one device driver "
"for each format that Ghostview is able to write. Different versions of "
"Ghostview often have different sets of device drivers available. It seems "

"<strong>gs --help</strong> to display the list of device drivers contained "
"in Ghostview. Among others, Okular can use the 'png256', 'jpeg' and 'pnm' "
"drivers. Note that Okular needs to be restarted to re-enable PostScript "
