"KTouch is a typewriter trainer for learning to touch type. It provides you "
"with text to train on and adjusts to different levels depending on how good "
"you are. It displays your keyboard and indicates which key to press next and "
"which is the correct finger to use. You learn typing with all fingers, step "
"by step, without having to look down at the keyboard to find your keys. It "
"is convenient for all ages and the perfect typing tutor for schools, "
"universities, and personal use. KTouch ships with dozens of different "
"courses in many languages and a comfortable course editor. Different "
"keyboard layouts are supported and new user-defined layouts can be created. "

"help you or your teacher to analyze your progress."
