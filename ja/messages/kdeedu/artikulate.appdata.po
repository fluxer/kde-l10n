"Artikulate is a pronunciation trainer that helps improving and perfecting a "
"learner's pronunciation skills for a foreign language. It provides courses "
"with native speaker recordings for several training languages. The learner "
"downloads those courses, selects a category of phrases to train, then starts "
"with recording her/his own voice when speaking the phrases and comparing the "
"results to the native speaker's recordings by listening to both. By "
"adjusting and repeating the own pronunciation, the learner can improve his/"
"her skill."
