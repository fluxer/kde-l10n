"KAlgebra is an application that can replace your graphing calculator. It has "
"numerical, logical, symbolic, and analysis features that let you calculate "
"mathematical expressions on the console and graphically plot the results in "
"2D or 3D. KAlgebra is rooted in the Mathematical Markup Language (MathML); "
"however, one does not need to know MathML to use KAlgebra."
