"children aged six and over. The game has several categories of words to play "
"with, for example: Animals (animals words) and three difficulty categories: "
"Easy, Medium and Hard. A word is picked at random, the letters are hidden, "
"and you must guess the word by trying one letter after another. Each time "
"you guess a wrong letter, part of a picture of a hangman is drawn. You must "
"guess the word before being hanged! You have 10 tries."
