"Get the piece of gold below the left side of the poles shaped like an 11 "

"right of you when on the floor and lure as many enemies as you can into the "
"section to the left of the 11.\n"
"\n"
"The first two tasks are relatively easy: the last task can be accomplished "
"in several ways.  If you run up the center ladder and move over the left, "
"you can wait above the right hand side of the poles (possibly dropping onto "
"the poles) and lure a few enemies at a time from the center section to the "
"left section.  You can also pick up a piece of gold or two while doing "
"this.\n"

"Once you have all the gold (except the pieces to the right of the 11), run "

"The grid of 12 boxes on the right is useful.  If you are on this grid but "

"\n"
"Another useful trick is to wait at the top of the ladder on the far left "
"(where you start the level).  Any enemies far enough away will run over the "
"top of the grid of boxes and drop into the trapped area on the right.\n"
"\n"
"To get the gold on the leftmost floor area, you need to fill the second "
"section of floor with enemies and dig out the squares that block the enemies "
"in the leftmost region.  You may want to lose that gold (i.e. have the enemy "
"carrying the gold enter a dug square and be destroyed there), although it is "
"possible to get this piece of gold if you really want it.\n"
"\n"
"If you leave the leftmost suspended gold until last, then it is easy to "
"escape to the top.  Alternatively, if you leave the gold inside the 2 for "
"last, you should be able to escape without much difficultly.  Otherwise, the "
