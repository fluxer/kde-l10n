"KStars is a desktop planetarium application. For any location, date, and "
"time on Earth, it provides an accurate graphical simulation of the night "
"sky. The display includes up to 100 million stars, 13,000 deep-sky objects, "
"all 8 planets, the Sun and Moon, and thousands of comets and asteroids. For "
"students and teachers, it supports adjustable simulation speeds in order to "
"view phenomena that happen over long timescales, the KStars Astrocalculator "
"to predict conjunctions, access to the Astroinfo project to help facilitate "
"learning, and Internet links for further information and pictures of "
"objects. Amateur astronomers can use KStars to plan their observations, use "
"the FOV Editor to calculate field of view of equipment and display them, use "
"the ObtainAAVSO light curves for variable stars, and get hints by the "
"\"What's up tonight tool\". KStars integrates INDI and supports a wide range "
"of instruments."
