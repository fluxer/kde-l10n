"KmPlot is a program to plot graphs of functions, their integrals or "
"derivatives. The graphs can be colorized and the view is highly "
"configurable, is scalable, and can be zoomed. The program features a "
"powerful mathematical parser, different plot types (cartesian, parametric, "
"polar, implicit, differential), and provides simple mathematical tools like "
"for finding maximum/minimum of a function. Parametrized functions can be "
"visualized by adjusting the variable parameter via a slider. Plots can be "
"exported as bitmap format pictures (BMP, PNG) and can be printed."
