"Kalzium is a program that shows you the Periodic Table of Elements. You can "
"use Kalzium to search for information about the elements or to learn facts "
"about the periodic table. It provides an overview of the important data "
"(like melting points, electron affinity, electron negativity, electron "
"configuration, radii, mass, ionisation energy), an isotope table, and "
"different colored views of the periodic table (separation of the different "
"blocks, year simulator, temperature simulator). It contains tools to "
"visualize the spectral lines of each element, a molecular weight calculator, "
"a 3D molecule editor, and an equation solver for stoichiometric problems."
